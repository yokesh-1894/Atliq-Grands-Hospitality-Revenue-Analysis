# Atliq-Grands-Hospitality-Revenue-Analysis

## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Knowledge gained from this Project 
1. Industry sector: Revenue Per Room(Revpar),Daily Sellable Room Night(DSRN) ,ADR- Average Daily Rate(ADR),Daily Booked Room Night(DBRN),Daily Utilized Room Night(DURN),No Show rate.
2. After looking into the cancellation policies of various hotels, I learned that the majority of hotels do not charge a fee if the booking is canceled more than three months before the booking date. However, if the cancellation occurs after that time, the fees typically range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.

## Key insights from the Dashboard

1. Mumbai leads in revenue generation with 661 Million, while Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi follow closely.
2. AtliQ Exotica outperforms all 7 property types with revenue of 320 million, a rating of 3.62, a 57% occupancy rate, and a 24.4% cancellation rate.
3. AtliQ Blu boasts the highest occupancy rate at 62.02%.
4. AtliQ suffered a loss of approximately 298 million due to cancellations.
5. Weekday Pricing and Weekend Pricing are almost similar.
6. The revenue generated from Atliq's own booking channel is unusually low. Typically, hotels experience higher revenue from their own channels, but this is not the case here. It is possible that they are not offering significant discounts on their own channel.
